# QChess
A chess-variant, in which you only state to which square you move, and the game then is a Superposition of all Game-States, in which this is possible, as soon as you make a move that is only possible in some of the states, the game collapses into only those states. Check and capture must be specified. Example-Moves are c3, xd5, c6 check, xa5 check
